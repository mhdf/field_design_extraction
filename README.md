# field_design_extraction

Turns spreadsheet field maps (croquis) and disease rating sheets into two kinds of tables:

- **design** — one row per plot: `plot_key`, `block_id`, `block_label`, `plot_number`, `row`, `column`
  (`row`/`column` are the plot's cell on the map);
- **ratings** — one file per date, only the rated plots: `plot_key`, `block_id`, `plot_number`, `date`,
  `disease` and the value columns you choose (e.g. `score`).

The two join on `plot_key` (`block:plot_number:row:column`; the position keeps it unique when a plot number
occurs twice).

## Install

In the Python environment that runs the project scripts:

```
pip install -e path\to\field_design_extraction
```

`-e` (editable) makes changes to the package code take effect without reinstalling.

## Use

A project script holds two settings dictionaries and runs the steps:

```python
import field_design_extraction as fde

designs = fde.build_designs(layouts)                    # map → design tables
ratings = fde.build_ratings(rating_sources, designs)    # ratings linked to plots
fde.export(layouts, rating_sources, designs, ratings)   # CSV files
```

Each step prints what it found: plots per block, plot numbers repeated within a block, and per date how many
ratings were linked and why the others were not.

### layouts — one entry per field map

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `workbook`, `sheet` | the map |
| `region` | Excel range holding the map, e.g. `"B2:AR11"` |
| `output_folder` | where the CSV files go (e.g. `dados/avaliacao_visual/consolidated`) |
| `blocks` | list of `{block_id, label, regions}`; `regions` are the Excel ranges of the block's plots |
| `unit_rules` | which cells count as plots (optional, also per block): `value_types`, `merged` (True/False/None), `anchor` (True: top-left cell of a merged range) |

A cell inside two blocks stops the run with the list of cells. Formula cells are read through the value Excel
saved.

### rating_sources — one entry per ratings workbook

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `layout_id` | the layout the ratings belong to |
| `disease`, `workbook` | |
| `assessments` | `{name: {sheet, date}}`; add `block` when each sheet holds one block |
| `header_row` | Excel row with the column names (default 1) |
| `plot_column` | column with the plot number |
| `block_column` | column with the block label; `None` when each sheet holds one block |
| `block_mapping` | block label in the ratings → `block_id` (optional when they are equal) |
| `value_columns` | columns to keep: `{name in the sheet: name in the output}` |

Rows without a plot number (e.g. MIN/MAX rows) are dropped. Ratings that cannot be linked go to
`<source>_<date>_unlinked.csv` with the reason (`link_status`).

### Checking the block ranges

`fde.read_cells(workbook, sheet, region)` returns every cell with value, merged range and fill color;
`fde.color_summary(cells)` groups them by color; `fde.plot_cells(cells, design)` draws the map with the plots of
each block marked.

## Tests

```
python -m unittest discover -s tests -t tests
```
